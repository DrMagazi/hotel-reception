## Introduction
A multi-platform desktop application designed for use by hotel staff for tasks such as booking of rooms.

This is a project I worked on with 6 other fellow students. We worked with accordance to Scrum
methodology over the course of ~3 months. 

My role was full-stack 
developer including the graphical design of the UI and at times I handled the responsibilities
of Scrum master. 

While this application has some short-comings, I suspect that with some improvements
and feedback from clients, this could be used in real hotels.
